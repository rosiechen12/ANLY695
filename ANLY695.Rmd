## Import Dataset and review



```{r}
Income_Data <- read.csv("Income Data.csv")
summary(Income_Data)
```


```{r}
str(Income_Data)
```
## Correlation Matrix

```{r}
library(corrplot)
plot(Income_Data$All_workers,Income_Data$All_weekly)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
